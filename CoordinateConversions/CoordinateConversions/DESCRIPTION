Description: This library provides the requisite functions to translate an 
              object from one coordinate system to another. It works in 
              Cartesian, Polar, Spherical, Cylindrical, and whatever 3D  
              would be. There is a conversion from each to each other, assuming 
              they contain the same number of dimensions. It will also find the 
              slope of a line when given one or two points (using the origin as
              needed).
