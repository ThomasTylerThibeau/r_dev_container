* Why?
** Hapax Legomena exists to track word usage.
** Use it to find your own unique words
*** (a hapax legomenon is a word that is only used once in a work,
*** and hapax legomena is the plural, so the group of words whose count is one)

This package was created as a final project for a math/computer-science course
at the Univeristy of Maine at Augusta by someone who holds interests in
grandiose vernacular, programming and mathematics.
