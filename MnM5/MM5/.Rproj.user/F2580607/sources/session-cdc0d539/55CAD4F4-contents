## orange because it's the only color that doesn't get spelled out, so it seems fair...

## #4
## no, they're not. Oh, you want more... okay.. shit (where's tableau when I need it?!) [kidding, of course]

## type-color-count (interesting that numeric sets it to a vector...)

## as I suspected, no... (I had an 18-bar plot, but, the counts on the different sizes fucked it up and the labeling
## was too difficult for me to figure out)
