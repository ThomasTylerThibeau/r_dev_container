## 1.) Geocode the addresses

hscsv <- read.csv("Data Files/MaineHighSchools.csv")  ## header = TRUE default
names(hscsv)                                          ## use "Mailing.Address"
## returns:
## School.Name, County Mailing.Address Location Class Region

## let's look at one of them
hscsv[1,'Mailing.Address']                            ## should I append ",USA" to each?

## pretend I have access to this, or substitute your own
register_google(key = "P-p-p-ppleaaase! Google! You KNOW ME! Just lemme get one, I PROMISE I'll pay you (Tuesday!)")

## add the ",USA" just in case?
hscsv$Geo.Code.This <- paste(hscsv$Mailing.Address, ", USA", sep = "")
hscsv[1,'Geo.Code.This']    ## test checks out

hsll <- geocode(hscsv$Mailing.Address)                ## not sure
llhs <- geocode(hscsv$Geo.Code.This)                  ## which to use


## 2.) Find which county each school belongs to (csv file contains county. overlay school districts and counties)

## create spatial of the hsll/llhs (again, I can't really test it)
coordinates(hsll) <- ~ lon + lat 
coordinates(llhs) <- ~ lon + lat

## why do I spell things like this? it's not kewl
skewlz <- hscsv$School.Name

proj4string(hsll) <- CRS("+proj=longlat+datum=WGS84") ## because the video did this?

## create the spatial file
hs.shp <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coordinates(hsll), data<-as.data.frame(skewlz))

## where are we? okay. so, hopefully we have a spatial file for the high schools
## the question suggests overlaying hs.shp & Maine Counties shape (non-existent atm)
## (even though hscsv$Region likely tells me everything I need to know, right?)
